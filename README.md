## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have not used html tables frequently; I tend to gravitate to css flexbox or grid. In this case, an html table seemed appropriate for the nutrition section.

### Continued development

I'm hoping to continue to learn about using html tables and how best to use them while prioritizing accessibility.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Styling_tables) - This helped me structure and style my html table. I really like this resource and will use it going forward.
